## Welcome!

Hey, my name is Charlie Duong (he, él, li, 他, etc.) and I'm a software engineer, researcher, and designer from Annandale, Virginia. I am student at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) studying Computer Science and Applied Math while exploring other areas like Pure Math, Cognitive Science, Entrepreneurship, and Chinese.

I'm interested in solving problems using software and hardware. My current interests include artificial intelligence/machine learning, FinTech (crypto, NFTs, smart contracts, DAOs, etc.), human computer interaction, full stack development, and product management.

On the side, I'm a pianist, swimmer, weight lifter, c/k/j pop/chill/rap enthusiast, and Tetris amateur.

In the past, I've invented a neurotechnology headset called Nujjet to help students optimize study habits and conducted NLP research at the Virginia Tech Data Analytics Center to accurately detect hate speech.

Now (Summer 2022), I'm exploring linear algebra, abstract algebra, and number theory, and helping revolution the legacy real estate market at Loqul.
