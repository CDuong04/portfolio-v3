## Welcome to my website!

My name is Charlie Duong and I'm a CS and Math major at Brown University from Annandale, Virginia.

I'm interested in AI/ML, full stack development, probability & statistics, and pure mathematics.

On the side, I lift weights, swim, stack colorful blocks, go to concerts and raves, explore cities, and meet new people.

I'm currently working on Cloud GPUs @ Tensordock, ML research @ Brown, TAing a machine learning class, and writing on my blog.

I'm also currently in the nice quaint town of Providence, Rhode Island.
