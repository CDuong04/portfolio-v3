Hey, my name is Charlie Duong (he, él, li, 他, etc.) and I'm a software engineer and researcher from Annandale, Virginia. I am a math and CS major at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/).

I'm interested in AI/ML, full stack development, probability & statistics, and pure mathematics. In the past, I've explored crypto, BCIs, and competitive programming. In the future, I'm looking to learn more about databses, cryptography, distributed systems, and theoretical CS.

On the side, I lift weights, swim, stack colorful blocks, go to concerts and raves, explore cities and meet new people.

I'm currently working on Cloud GPUs @ [Tensordock](https://tensordock.com/), ML research @ Brown advised by the wonderful [Stephen Bach](https://cs.brown.edu/people/sbach/), TAing a machine learning class, and writing on my [blog](/blog).

In the past, I built a built a BCI headset called [Nujjet](https://nujjet.com/) that won [some](https://diamondchallenge.org/) [cool](https://www.gatsvi.org/) [competitions](https://www.conradchallenge.org/), conducted ML Research @ Virginia Tech advised by the amazing [Chang-Tien Lu](https://people.cs.vt.edu/ctlu/) where I published a [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10020510/) on hate speech detection in [IEEE Big Data](https://bigdataieee.org/BigData2022/), and did some [competitive](http://www.usaco.org/) [programming](https://codeforces.com/).

At Brown, I've been a part of some awesome communities such as VSA, CS DUG, Powerlifting, and Delta Tau, as well some unofficial communities such as Ev Pol 4 and the CIT. Outside of school, I've also been a part of [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) and the [Conrad Challenge](https://www.conradchallenge.org/) Alumni Council.

I love meeting new people so feel free to reach out to me via email or add me on any of the following platforms (I wish I had a more original username):
